# Task 3 unit testing
1. adding new test cases for battery and engines
2. modify old test cases for the new design 

# Task 4 Modify Spindler battery, adding new functionality
1. change Spindler battery service criteria from 2 years to 3 years and change old test cases accordingly 
2. add new module tires to add the functionality for tire serviceability check 
3. add test cases to test new tire module
NOTE: - It is not given which car fleet type uses which tire, so Iâ€™m assuming that tires are not fixed for a different type of fleet and keeping it separate from the car_factory method.
